{{< about-section
    title="About me"
    content="Software Development is my calling. Ever since I can remember I have been curious about what makes technology work, not only how it works but also why it works. I am a software developer and through the years I have been building various projects that I am excited for you to see. </br>Besides my skill set, I heed to three core principles that I bring to any team, company or project. </br><ul><li><strong>Time Management</strong> – I plan my workday ahead prioritizing each task accordingly regardless of personal fears and desires.</li> </br><li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – I joined Toastmasters because I believe that a successful project is the product of good communication between all parties involved be it other developers or end users.</li> </br><li><strong>Professionalism</strong> – My code represents who I am, it is going to be read by other developers and be of use to users.</li></ul> </br>My goal is for other programmers to see what I write and instantly know that I am committed to the craft. Although I’m familiar with an array of programming languages and tools, C++ became the love of my life and I use it whenever I can. That is the reason why I am passionate about the Qt framework and Unreal Engine."
