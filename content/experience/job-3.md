### Runscore a legendary timing software

I work in the Runscore team which is a legacy application that is still popular with users who time racing events and thriathlons. I have identified parts of the code that can be modernized from C to current C++ standards making the application run performantly in modern systems.
As part of my tasks I write C++ code to fix bugs and crashes, plan and add requested features, perform code review and write Unit Tests for existing or new code.
