### Backend Developer - The Citywide Group

Using python-flask I created the groundwork for an REST API for a home automation system.
Part of my tasks were to research about proper frameworks to use. Implement automatic code generation with Swagger Codegen, YML and mustache.
Perform code reviews and plan with my team new features for the the API.
